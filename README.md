## ⚡TLDR

* Recursive Request Exploits (RRE) trace API chains backward from a protected resource (like a video stream) back to it's origin.
* If any upstream API is unauthenticated, the whole chain can be abused to bypass access
* This Burp extension automates this to find low-trust inputs that generate high-value outputs

## What Is an RRE?

Recursive Request Exploits (RRE) are a methodology for **recursively tracing interdependent web requests** to discover how digital entitlements (e.g., video streams) are generated — and where validation breaks down.

What makes RRE unique, and hard to detect, is that it follows the business logic of the app. Instead of attacking one endpoint or API, you recursively walk the entire stream of requests that led to a sensitive output. If any request in that chain isn't properly authenticated, the entire workflow can be compromised and an entitlement can be spoofed.

A hypothetical RRE workflow is demonstrated below:

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jumpycastle/rre-burp.git
2. In Burp Suite:
* Go to Extensions > Add
* Load the .py file manually
✅ Python Jython required (Burp Professional with Jython support)


---
## RRE Usage

1. Launch Burp Suite Professional with your browser configured to use it as a proxy.
2. Load the RRE Extension via the Extensions tab. (Until it’s in the BApp Store, you can import the Python code manually.)
3. Authenticate to the target app e.g., a hypothetical streaming service.
4. Navigate to the page that loads a protected resource, such as a video stream (.m3u8, .mp4, etc.).
5. Right-click the request in Burp and select the parameter tied to the entitlement (e.g., stream_id, see GIF below).
6. Go to Extensions > Output to view the recursive trace.
7. For vulnerable apps, you’ll see a chain of unauthenticated or low-trust API calls that ultimately lead to a high-value response. The GIF below demonstrates the flow.

8. Build your exploit chain by chaining together the discovered APIs using only the low-trust inputs. This simulates how a real attacker could bypass authentication by abusing the same business logic flow.

## 🛠 Optional: Configure Shannon Entropy

RRE enumeration begins by identifying high-value outputs like stream tokens, access keys, or asset IDs. These are typically random-looking values with high Shannon entropy, indicating they were generated by the backend and are difficult to guess or forge.

By default, the RRE extension uses a **Shannon entropy threshold of 3.0** to flag potentially high-value parameters. This means any value with an entropy above 3.0 (bits/char) will be considered as a starting point for recursive tracing.

### What is Shannon Entropy?

Shannon entropy is a measure of randomness. In the context of web security, higher entropy often means a value is:

- Backend-generated
- Hard to predict or guess
- Likely tied to access controls or entitlements

The RRE extension highlights these values as potential targets for trace discovery, and then recursively looks up the next call to build a full trace.

For example:

| Value                             | Entropy (bits/char) | Likely Use                     |
|----------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| `vod-abc123`                     | 2.85                 | Probably low-value metadata    |
| `vod_X3g1Vq94MPY7z9A.m3u8`       | 4.91                 | High-value stream ID 🎯         |
| `public-event`                   | 2.32                 | Static slug / low trust input  |



### 🔧 Customizing the Threshold

If you’d like to adjust this threshold, you can edit the following line in the `rre_burp.py` file:

Code reference (see block 3):
![Shannon Entropy Threshold](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/1*DPK9cHcSennD01-fmELLDg.png)

and adjust the value:
```python
entropy > 3.0
```
